A Simple Prufer Project
========

This is a simple program to create Linked List trees of ints from Prufer Code. It takes in an array of ints that are the
 prufer code, and then uses them to generate first a 2-D array representation of the tree, and then the tree itself. 
 
 The project will eventually work in the other way. 
 
 Still in the testing phase.
